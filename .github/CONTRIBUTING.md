#Contributor Guidelines

Interesting in helping out with this project? Awesome!

Not sure what you can do? Don't worry. Even the fact that you opened this file is a sign that you care about the project, and that means a lot.

But if you're looking for more concrete actions:

## Issues

If you find a bug in the app, or even if you run into some bit of text or an explanation that's unclear, [file an issue](https://github.com/jonseitz/inclusive-harvard-map/issues/new).

If you have ideas for improvements to the app, [file an issue](https://github.com/jonseitz/inclusive-harvard-map/issues/new).

As far as I'm concerned, nothing it too small to open a ticket about. I'll do my best to respond to all of them.

If you have something you'd rather discuss offline, you can [contact me directly](mailto:git-questions@jonathanseitz.com).

## Pull Requests

If you'd rather get your hands dirty in the code, pull requests are always welcome. Small bugfixes can be opened from scratch, but larger features should be opened as an issue **before** you start working on code. That way we can confer on scope and whether it makes sense for the project.

If you've never opened a pull request before, see [Github's instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

A few requirements for any pull request:

### Documentation

All code should include proper [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) inline documentation. Docs will be generated automatically and reviewed as part of regular Code Review. Whenever possible try to follow the format of other code in the library, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you have them.

### Testing

Everything should be tested. We're using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for all client and server testing.
